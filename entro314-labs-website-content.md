### What We Actually Build

#### Production Systems (Real Revenue, Real Users)

**FairRent ML System**
- **What it does:** Objective rental price scoring for Greek market using 30+ economic indicators
- **Tech reality:** Python ML on Azure, €35/month operating costs, 99.89% model accuracy
- **Why it matters:** First data-driven approach to rental fairness in Greece's €2B market
- **Status:** Live production, actual paying users

**AI Changelog Generator**
- **What it does:** Turns messy git commits into readable changelogs using smart AI model selection
- **Tech reality:** Node.js CLI + MCP server, works with GPT-4o/o3/o4, 100% feature parity
- **Why it matters:** Developers hate writing changelogs, this actually works
- **Status:** Live npm package with growing adoption

#### Developer Tools (Open Source, Community Driven)

**VibeCodingRules Framework**
- **What it does:** Makes any AI coding assistant project-aware through static analysis
- **Tech reality:** Universal compatibility (Cursor/VS Code/Claude/Copilot), 51+ task rules
- **Why it matters:** Generic AI suggestions suck, this makes them contextual
- **Status:** Active community, used by Fortune 500 teams

**Cascade Backup Tool**
- **What it does:** Backup and search Windsurf conversations using reverse-engineered Chrome DevTools
- **Tech reality:** CDP protocol extraction, fuzzy search, multiple fallback methods
- **Why it matters:** Windsurf users lose valuable conversation history
- **Status:** Beta testing, positive community feedback

**DotFiles Manager for macOS**
- **What it does:** Native macOS app for dotfile management with local AI analysis
- **Tech reality:** Swift + Core Data, no cloud dependency, CLI companion
- **Why it matters:** Configuration management still sucks in 2024
- **Status:** Swift development, approaching release

#### Research Projects (Exploring New Ideas)

**Mountain Path Framework**
- **What it explores:** Energy-based project management for neurodivergent teams
- **Core concept:** Multiple valid paths to the same goal, psychological safety first
- **Why it matters:** Traditional PM breaks different thinking patterns
- **Status:** Research phase, early prototyping

**Warm Sunset Design System**
- **What it provides:** Complete accessibility-first design system
- **Tech reality:** WCAG 2.1 compliant, multi-framework support, neurodivergent-friendly
- **Why it matters:** Inclusive design as foundation, not afterthought
- **Status:** Complete system, ready for implementation

### Technical Philosophy

**Build Real Solutions**
- Production systems with actual users and revenue
- Open source tools that developers adopt in practice
- Research that leads to implemented frameworks
- Privacy-first approaches (local AI when possible)

**Embrace Different Minds**
- Neurodivergent-friendly design patterns as default
- Multiple interaction modes (CLI + GUI options)
- Accessibility as core requirement, not bolt-on
- Recognition that diverse minds work differently

**Ship and Learn**
- Weekend experiments that become production tools
- Community feedback drives feature development
- Document failures alongside successes
- Open source when it benefits everyone
